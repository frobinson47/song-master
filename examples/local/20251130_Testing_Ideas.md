### Song Lyrics:
## Testing Ideas

[Verse 1]  
Cracked coffee cup on the kitchen sink,  
Steam still rising—water’s been cold for hours.  
A letter folded twice in my coat pocket—  
The name I wrote, then erased, then rewrote.  
Saw it in the subway light,  
A face I still see in every mirror.  
No map, no proof—just the weight of a word  
I’ve carried since the night you left.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t need a name,  
I don’t need a stage—  
The silence broke, and my voice found its way.  
Got the wound, got the truth,  
Gonna say it now—no more running.

[Chorus]  
Feel the rush, feel the rise—  
No fear, no lie—just the truth that won’t stay quiet.  
One breath, and the air went still—  
The world held its breath, and I heard my own name.  
Yeah, I’m testin’ ideas,  
Gonna break the mold, gonna make it real—  
One word, and the silence breaks.

[Verse 2]  
Wired for waiting, built for the pause,  
Got a line I’ve written, and I’m gonna say it.  
From the train’s cold hum to the stair’s worn wood,  
From the silence to the breath I’ve been afraid to say.  
I don’t care if it’s right or wrong—  
If it breaks, it’s already strong.  
Got a rhythm in my throat,  
A truth I’ve been afraid to speak—  
And I’ve been told I’m too soft to be heard.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t need a plan,  
I don’t need a plan—  
The silence broke, and my voice found its way.  
Got the fire, got the drive,  
Gonna light it up, gonna give it life.

[Chorus]  
Feel the rush, feel the rise—  
No fear, no lie—just the truth that won’t stay quiet.  
One breath, and the air went still—  
The world held its breath, and I heard my own name.  
Yeah, I’m testin’ ideas,  
Gonna break the mold, gonna make it real—  
One word, and the silence breaks.

[Bridge]  
No second guess, no time to wait—  
The world’s a cup, and I’m the hand that holds it.  
I don’t need a name, I don’t need a crown—  
Just the word I’ve been afraid to say.

[Big Finish]  
[Explosive Riff]  
[Choir]  
[Male Vocal]  
[Chorus — Gang Vocals, Anthemic, Full Band]  
Feel the rush, feel the rise—  
No fear, no lie—just the truth that won’t stay quiet.  
One breath, and the air went still—  
The world held its breath, and I heard my own name.  
Yeah, I’m testin’ ideas,  
Gonna break the mold, gonna make it real—  
One word, and the silence breaks.
