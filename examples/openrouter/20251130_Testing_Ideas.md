## Testing Ideas

[Intro] [style: 80s hair metal, glam rock, arena rock, party anthem, high-energy]  
Lights rise, crowds surge, hearts rumble through the night  
We cut the neon haze, break open the sky’s white  

[Verse 1] [style: 80s hair metal]  
Got a wild plan ridin’ on the restless air  
Clear visions sparkin’ as the brave ones dare  
Chasin’ echoes down a half‑lit road  
Every bold impulse primed to overload  

[Pre-chorus] [style: glam rock]  
Turn it up, turn it up, feel the pull draw near  
Unchained heartbeats roarin’ loud and clear  

[Chorus] [style: arena rock, anthemic]  
We’re breakin’ the silence, makin’ truth reveal  
Pushin’ the edge till the moment feels real  
Cut through the doubt, shake off the old fear  
Lift your voice high — we’re breakin’ the silence  

[Verse 2] [style: hair metal swagger]  
Got a live spark rollin’ through the riff  
A shockwave risin’ with a skyline lift  
Every wrong turn feeds fire to our mark  
We carve our path with voices cuttin’ the dark  

[Pre-chorus] [style: glam metal]  
Turn it up, turn it up, let the weight fall free  
Every strike we throw’s a raw victory  

[Chorus] [style: arena rock, anthemic]  
We’re breakin’ the silence, makin’ truth reveal  
Pushin’ the edge till the moment feels real  
Cut through the doubt, shake off the old fear  
Lift your voice high — we’re breakin’ the silence  

[Guitar Solo — wild, bend-heavy, high-energy]

[Bridge] [style: power ballad dynamics]  
When the world says “stop,” we just shout back “go!”  
Every spark hits harder, drivin’ through the low  
Hold tight to the madness, feel the quake come down  
We light the whole sky up every time we stand our ground  

[Chorus] [style: arena rock + gang vocals]  
We’re breakin’ the silence, makin’ truth reveal  
Pushin’ the edge till the moment feels real  
Cut through the doubt, shake off the old fear  
Lift your voice high — we’re breakin’ the silence  

[Big Finish]  
Breakin’ the silence — keep shoutin’ through the years!
