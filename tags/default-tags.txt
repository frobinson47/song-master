# SUNO AI TAGS FOR SONG GENERATION
# =================================
# This file contains structured tags for AI song generation.
# Use these tags to control musical elements, structure, and style.
# Tags should be combined logically to create coherent musical sections.

# USAGE GUIDELINES FOR AI:
# 1. Combine structural tags with musical attributes for best results
# 2. Use proper musical notation: Tempo: <number> BPM, Key: <key> <mode>
# 3. Match mood, genre, and dynamics for consistency
# 4. Vocal tags should complement the musical style
# 5. Instrument tags should be specific and appropriate for the genre

# =================================
# AI COMBINING RULES
# =================================
# 1. Always pair structural tags with genre and tempo
# 2. Match mood to dynamic level (e.g., "Explosive energy" with "Uplifting, celebratory")
# 3. Ensure vocal style matches genre (e.g., "Rapid-fire delivery" for Hip Hop)
# 4. **CRITICAL: Always specify vocal gender for every sung section** using appropriate tags: [Female Vocal], [Male Vocal], [Duet], [Female Narrator], [Male - deep baritone], etc. Never leave vocal gender ambiguous unless the section is explicitly instrumental.
# 5. For duets or songs with multiple vocalists, clearly tag which section belongs to which vocalist using tags like [Call and Response - Female to Male], [Alternating Vocals], or specific section headers like [Male Response]
# 6. Keep instrument selections genre-appropriate
# 7. Use vocal quality to enhance the emotional impact
# 8. Consider key changes between sections for musical interest
# 9. Tempo can vary between sections but should flow naturally
# 10. Ensure vocal gender assignments are consistent with the song's narrative and emotional arc
